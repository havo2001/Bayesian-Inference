# Bayesian-Inference
* Focused on Bayesian analysis using prior distributions in the context of a normal distribution by first simulating a dataset with small observations from a normal distribution with a given mean
* Analyzed the posterior densities, simulated draws from the posterior, found the posterior density for a transformed parameter, calculated posterior intervals, obtained MAP estimates, and compared the results with maximum likelihood estimates and frequentist confidence intervals
* Skills: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Statistics
