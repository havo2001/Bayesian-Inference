# Bayesian Analysis with Prior Distributions in the Context of a Normal Distribution
This project focuses on Bayesian analysis using prior distributions in the context of a normal distribution. It involves the following key steps:
* Data Simulation: We start by simulating a dataset with a small number of observations from a normal distribution. The mean of this normal distribution is pre-specified.

* Bayesian Analysis: We analyze the posterior densities of the parameters, simulate draws from the posterior distribution, and perform various Bayesian calculations to understand the uncertainty and distribution of the parameters.

* Transformation: In addition to analyzing the posterior densities of the original parameters, we explore the posterior density for a transformed parameter. This demonstrates how Bayesian analysis can be extended to more complex models and transformations.

* Posterior Intervals: We calculate posterior intervals to capture the uncertainty in parameter estimates. These intervals are essential for understanding the range of plausible values for the parameters.

* Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Estimates: We obtain MAP estimates for the parameters. These estimates provide a point estimate that maximizes the posterior distribution and helps identify the most likely parameter values.

* Comparison: Finally, we compare the results obtained through Bayesian analysis, including posterior intervals and MAP estimates, with maximum likelihood estimates and frequentist confidence intervals. This comparison highlights the differences and advantages of a Bayesian approach.
